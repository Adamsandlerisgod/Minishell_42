	- when using export funciton, and I call the variable with echo it wont print. 
	- the error appears in my mallocer, function which has no problems so it means there's a memory problem that occurs before hand that needs fixing. (shit aint freed);
	 -->not an error in expander(thats all gucci)
	- solve issue of variable names that start with the same. (solved)
	- quotetrimmer needs to be adjusted to new set_env.
	quote trimmer is a biiiiiiitch(solved).
	- verify the implementation of the array of cmd >> array is not null terminated.(solved)
	- with pipe, the structfill is messing up when it comes to the second cmd struct.(solved)
	- look up signal stuff for signal implementation
	- exit status variable function


	- add option to ask for the last command in case of nothing after the pipe (exemple: "ls |"), 
		apparently the bash open an heredoc to catch the next command and take it as limiter.
		Actually it return an error message "You have failed you sonofbitch" and the next entry in prompt make segmentation fault.
		Maybe let see together for this part if you need help to understand heredoc to use it.

### The "Minishell" project at 42 school challenges participants to develop a minimalistic Unix shell. This project provides an opportunity to delve into the fundamentals of shell programming, emphasizing process creation, signal handling, and command execution.

### Key Points:

**Basic Shell Functionality**: Participants are tasked with creating a simplified shell capable of handling basic command-line operations. This includes parsing commands, executing them, and managing the shell environment.

**Process Creation and Execution**: Efficient process creation and execution are fundamental aspects of the project. Participants utilize system calls such as fork(), execve(), and waitpid() to manage processes and execute commands within the shell.

**Signal Handling**: The project may involve handling signals like Ctrl+C (SIGINT) and Ctrl+\ (SIGQUIT). This provides participants with insight into signal management within a Unix-like environment.

**Command Parsing and Execution**: The development of a command parser is essential. Participants create a mechanism to interpret user input, identify commands, and execute them appropriately.

**Environment Variables**: Similar to the "pipex" project, participants may be required to manipulate environment variables within the shell.

**Methodology**:
The project encourages participants to adopt a systematic approach, starting with command parsing and building the foundation for process creation and execution. Understanding signal handling and incorporating it into the shell adds an additional layer of complexity to the implementation.

**Assessment**:
Evaluation is based on the correct implementation of essential shell functionalities, proper process management, effective command parsing, and accurate handling of signals. Attention to detail in error handling, adherence to project specifications, and well-organized code contribute to the overall assessment.

The "Minishell" project offers participants practical experience in developing a basic Unix shell, honing their skills in process management and command execution. It serves as a stepping stone for understanding more advanced concepts in system programming and shell development.

	-- - when using export funciton, and I call the variable with echo it wont print. 
	-- - the error appears in my mallocer, function which has no problems so it means there's a memory problem that occurs before hand that needs fixing. (shit aint freed);
	 -->not an error in expander(thats all gucci)
	-- - solve issue of variable names that start with the same. (solved)
	-- - quotetrimmer needs to be adjusted to new set_env.
	-- quote trimmer is a biiiiiiitch(solved).
	-- - verify the implementation of the array of cmd >> array is not null terminated.(solved)
	-- - with pipe, the structfill is messing up when it comes to the second cmd struct.(solved)
	-- - look up signal stuff for signal implementation
	-- - exit status variable function


	-- - add option to ask for the last command in case of nothing after the pipe (exemple: "ls |"), 
	-- 	apparently the bash open an heredoc to catch the next command and take it as limiter.
	-- 	Actually it return an error message "You have failed you sonofbitch" and the next entry in prompt make segmentation fault.
	-- 	Maybe let see together for this part if you need help to understand heredoc to use it.

	-- - Ctrl + c prints "minishell : minishell : minishell :"
	-- - Ctrl + d works but can cause segmentation fault

	-- - ADD in argument in the 2d array the infiles without the "<" only the infiles
	-- - IMP in the input the the entry of last command if missing

	minishell-hh: /: is a directory
	minishell-hh$ echo $?
	126
	minishell-hh$ /fea
	minishell-hh: /fea: command not found
	minishell(69899,0x1109fadc0) malloc: *** error for object 0x7fde29604a00: pointer being freed was not allocated
	minishell(69899,0x1109fadc0) malloc: *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
	zsh: abort      ./minishell
	
	To do in english:
		-get line

	- IMP heredoc before send data struct for execution (sorted)
	- IMP the opening of every files of the cmd (stop if one file fail), command by command and return an error command if need with the str_error
	- IMP the path for every command (okay)
	- Return the fd_in and fd_out // if do not have return -2
		- USE last infile and last outfiles for the redirection with the type (O_APPEND/O_TRUNC/O_RDONLY)

- Do the int status variable in s_cmd, in PATH instead of error message(bc now we exit)

TASK DONE
-- - copy wolfs beautiful get_env_value function to find path
-- - verify if the pipes working < = pipe work but need to change some implementation part to reset de STDIN_FILENO 'dup'
-- - take a shower
-- -doing the redirection for input and output file.
-- - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3Kvu6Kgp88
-- - ./minishell implementation
-- - correction of Builtin function
